Tech is my passion since my childhood. Every broken stuff, such as radio or a cellphone, never passed throug my eyes. I inspected then inside and out, feeding the little beast of curiosity living inside me. I broke and fixed things on the way growing and improoving skills as:

            Âº Patience
            Âº Endurance
            Âº Passion
            Âº Precision
            Âº Step-by-step work (the screws disappear or appear)

And ALWAYS finished what I have started.

This curious child is a grown-up right now. Full of passion for knowlegde and facts. I am constantly learning , cultural knowledge or languages, or acquiring problem solving skills. My mind never stops, neither my hunger to absorbe all the possibilities the world gives us every day.

My restlessness led me to obtain working experience in various fields. And when I say various , I mean it. I went from working in wharehouses, hotels, clothing stores to planning events and managing Erasmus+ Projects. I have worked in pretty much all sectors possible and I am proud of it, because it made me the person I am today, and gave the knowledge and experience I have.
So I believe that I am a perfect fit for any company that is about to hire me, Just do it and you will see
